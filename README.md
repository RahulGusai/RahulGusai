## Building production-grade AI agents — not demos.

Deep in agentic systems mode — designing AI workflows that actually ship.

After **5 years in backend-heavy product companies** and **1.5+ years freelancing**, I specialize in the foundation most AI builders skip:

- Scalable system architecture  
- Clean data modeling  
- Retrieval & orchestration pipelines  
- Async processing & infra design  
- Agent reliability in production  

AI agents are only as good as the systems behind them.  
That’s where I operate.

## 🧩 What I'm Doing

- Living inside AI workflows — building agent-first products  
- Experimenting with RAG, orchestration layers, and tool execution patterns  
- Designing backend systems that scale beyond prototype phase  
- Turning messy processes into automated agent pipelines  
- Writing, refining, and deploying production-ready agent architectures

## 🛠 Philosophy

Most people are building prompts.  
I build systems.

Agents need:
- Deterministic backbones  
- Reliable storage  
- Observability  
- Guardrails  
- Clean abstractions  

That’s where long-term leverage lives.

Hi there. 👋
 
 💻 I have been doing freelancing in software engineering from past one and half year. Before that, I worked as a full-time software engineer in product based companies.
 🌱 My approach to life and work both is BFS. I love to experience different horizons and expand my perspectives.
 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting ideas and projects — that’s the whole point of freelancing for me!     
 ❤️ I am a problem solver by heart. It is the primary reason I associate with software engineering.
